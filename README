Mastermind

'java mastermind.MastermindDriver' will run the game and changing the boolean value in main() will enable the game to run in easy mode.

New games configurations can be added in MastermindGameFactory and all games can be defined in three parameters: no. of attempts, no. of pegs and a set
of pegs to chose from (see GameDetails.java)

AttemptEvauluator will match type of guesses against any type of pegs but to use the normal command line the GameInputter converts from a Character
to a <? extends Tokeniser<String> type so any new GameDetails to should take this into consideration (see MastermindGameFactory)

All output prompts and messages are contained in outputFormatter.properties if changes are required.
